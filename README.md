# tabSort
This is Chrome extension for sorting tabs I designed in 2019. It has been published onto the Chrome Web Store. See https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tabsort/ghfbcpmgicbkafifmnbigfljgecjpnil 

I'm particularly proud of this app since it's not a gimmick or a project I made just to show off to employers â€” this is something I routinely use while browsing the internet.
